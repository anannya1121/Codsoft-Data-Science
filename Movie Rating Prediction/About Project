Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction project aims to predict the ratings of movies based on various features such as genre, director, cast, and user demographics. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict movie ratings, helping streaming services, movie recommendation systems, and users make informed decisions.

Objectives
To explore and analyze the movie rating dataset.
To preprocess the data and engineer relevant features.
To apply machine learning algorithms, specifically the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor, to predict movie ratings.
To evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Relative Absolute Error (RAE).
Algorithms Used
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor
SGD Regressor is a linear model fitted by minimizing a regularized empirical loss with stochastic gradient descent. It is particularly useful for large-scale and sparse machine learning problems.
