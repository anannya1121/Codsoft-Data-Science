Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. This project uses machine learning techniques to build predictive models and evaluates their performance.

Objectives
To understand the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.
To apply various machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.
To evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
To provide a robust prediction system for new data.
